You will need CMake 2.4.4 or newer.  If your Linux distribution
doesn't provide CMake, or if it provides an older version, you can get
it here:

    http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

There are ready to use binary packages available for Linux from
that page.  If you must build it from source, please read the instructions
supplied here:

    http://www.cmake.org/HTML/install.html
    
Building with CMake
-------------------

Unpack the tarball or check out CVS.  Assuming that you have the
source in ~/src/kmidimon, you need to change to that directory:

$ cd ~/src/kmidimon

Now run CMake to generate the build files.

$ cmake .

Finally, run make, and then (sudo) make install, and you're done.

$ make
# make install

To uninstall, use:

# make uninstall

Advanced Build Options
----------------------

By default, make will output brief details of each build step.  If you
prefer to see full command lines, use:

$ make VERBOSE=1

The default installation directory will be the same where your KDE 3 
is already installed, as reported by the command:

$ kde-config --prefix  

You may install kmidimon to /usr/local or anywhere else, but if you 
do so, you must add that location to your KDEDIRS environment variable 
before running kmidimon. For example:

$ export KDEDIRS=/usr/local:$KDEDIRS
$ kmidimon

Another option, useful for packagers, is setting DESTDIR at install
time. The DESTDIR directory will be prepended to the prefix when
copying the files:

$ make install DESTDIR=~/rpmroot

Some variables you may want to set:

    * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:
      cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kde is the equivalent to
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde for programs that use autotools

    * WANT_XXXX: there are several options, e.g. WANT_JACK or WANT_DSSI. 
      If you disable them, cmake will not even try to find the packages. 

    WANT_DEBUG   Include debug support (default OFF)
    WANT_FULLDBG Full debug support (BIG executables!) (default OFF)
    WANT_PCH     Use precompiled headers (default OFF)

The above options can take any of the following values: 0, 1, OFF, ON,
TRUE, FALSE, YES, NO (case insensitive). For example:

$ cmake . -DWANT_DEBUG=YES -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

To enable FULLDBG you also need to enable DEBUG.

If you would prefer to avoid all this typing, you can use ccmake to
view and change these options using a friendly curses-based interface:

$ ccmake .

Dealing with Configuration Problems
