You will need CMake 2.6.0 or newer.  If your Linux distribution
doesn't provide CMake, or if it provides an older version, you can get
it here:

    http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

There are ready to use binary packages available for Linux from
that page.  If you must build it from source, please read the instructions
supplied here:

    http://www.cmake.org/HTML/install.html
    
Building with CMake
-------------------

Unpack the tarball or check out SVN.  Assuming that you have the
source in ~/src/kmidimon, you need to change to that directory:

$ cd ~/src/kmidimon

Create a build directory, and change to it

$ mkdir build
$ cd build

Now run CMake to generate the build files.

$ cmake ..

Finally, run make, and then (sudo) make install, and you're done.

$ make
$ sudo make install

To uninstall, use:

$ sudo make uninstall

Advanced Build Options
----------------------

By default, make will output brief details of each build step.  If you
prefer to see full command lines, use:

$ make VERBOSE=1

Another option, useful for packagers, is setting DESTDIR at install
time. The DESTDIR directory will be prepended to the prefix when
copying the files:

$ make install DESTDIR=~/rpmroot

Some variables you may want to set:

    * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kde is the equivalent to
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde for programs that use autotools

    * there are some options available:  
    STATIC_DRUMSTICK  Statically linked drumstick (default ON)
    ENABLE_PCH        Use precompiled headers (default OFF)

The above options can take any of the following values: 0, 1, OFF, ON,
TRUE, FALSE, YES, NO (case insensitive). For example:

$ cmake .. -ENABLE_PCH=YES -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

If you would prefer to avoid all this typing, you can use ccmake to
view and change these options using a friendly curses-based interface:

$ ccmake ..

or a GUI equivalent:

$ cmake-gui ..

Dealing with Configuration Problems
